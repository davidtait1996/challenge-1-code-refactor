# Challenge 1: Code Refactor



## Description

We were given code for this website, but it wasn't done very efficiently nor with accessibility in mind. Our job was to optimize the given website without altering the visuals of the site.

## What I did

Added an appropriate title instead of "website"  
Added comments in the CSS and HTML  
Renamed some divs to HTML semantic tags  
Simplified classes - there was a lot of repeating of CSS, so I renamed some HTML classes to allow better sharing of CSS

## Built with
HTML  
CSS
